**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 

## Style Points (10 pts)

## Submission Steps (10 pts)

1. This problem set is a paired problem set.

2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person Partner 1.

  • Partner 1 (Hiroaki Kurachi and hiroakik):

  • Partner 2 (Luis Senires and ldsenires):

3. Partner 1 will accept the ps4 and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted.

4. “This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy.” Add your initials to indicate your agreement: **HK** **__**

5. “I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set here” (1 point)

6. Late coins used this pset: **__** Late coins left after submission: **__**

7. Knit your ps4.qmd to an PDF file to make ps4.pdf,

  • The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use head() and re-size figures when appropriate.

8. (Partner 1): push ps4.qmd and ps4.pdf to your github repo.

9. (Partner 1): submit ps4.pdf via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.

10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import os

import warnings 
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

## Download and explore the Provider of Services (POS) file (10 pts)

1. 

The variables we selected are;

- PRVDR_NUM: CMS certification number

- PRVDR_CTGRY_CD: the type of provider participating in the Medicare/Medicaid program

- PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD: the subtype of the provider, within the primary category

- FAC_NAME: name of the provider certified to participate in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs

- CITY_NAME: city in which the provider is physically located

- ST_ADR: street address where the provider is located

- ZIP_CD; five-digit ZIP code for a provider's physical address

- TRMNTN_EXPRTN_DT: date the provider was terminated

2. 

```{python}
# Set the absolute path of the data folder
base = (r"C:\Users\hkura\Documents\Uchicago\04 2024 Autumn\Python2\problem-set-4-hiro-luis\data")
path_dataset = os.path.join(base,"pos2016.csv")

# Load 2016 dataset
df_pos2016 = pd.read_csv(path_dataset)

# Define function to subset a dataset for short-term hospitals
def subset_short_term(df):
    df_result = df[(df["PRVDR_CTGRY_CD"] == 1)&(df["PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD"] == 1)]
    return df_result

# Create short-term hospitals subsets for 2016 dataset
df_pos2016_short = subset_short_term(df_pos2016)
```

    a.    
```{python}
# Count the column number
print(len(df_pos2016_short))

# Check if there are no PRVDR_NUM with more than 2 columns
print(len(df_pos2016_short["PRVDR_NUM"].value_counts()))
```

    This subset for short-term hospitals in 2016 includes 7245 hospitals.

    DOES THIS NUMBER MAKE SENSE?

    b. We couldn't find references which includes the exact number of short-term hospitals at the end of 2016, but the 2016 CMS statistics specifies the number as 3,436 for the Dec 31, 2015, which is the most recent data available in the search result(https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/CMS-Statistics-Reference-Booklet/Downloads/2016_CMS_Stats.pdf).

    Considering the number 3,436 at the end of 2015, 7245 is drastically larger, even considering the change in one year.

    As far as we could find, there seems no substantial policy change in 2016, which could potentially change the number of healthcare providers drastically.

    As both the dataset we use and the cross-reference are both published by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, it might be plausible to assume their credibilities. And as the dataset dictionary says nothing about change in definition of the provider categories/sub-categories. Then one reason we can consider is, for instance, the change in the data gathering methods.
