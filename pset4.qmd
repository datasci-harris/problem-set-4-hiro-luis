**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
We use (`*`) to indicate a problem that we think might be time consuming. 

## Style Points (10 pts)

## Submission Steps (10 pts)

1. This problem set is a paired problem set.

2. Play paper, scissors, rock to determine who goes first. Call that person Partner 1.

  • Partner 1 (Hiroaki Kurachi and hiroakik):

  • Partner 2 (Luis Senires and ldsenires):

3. Partner 1 will accept the ps4 and then share the link it creates with their partner. You can only share it with one partner so you will not be able to change it after your partner has accepted.

4. “This submission is our work alone and complies with the 30538 integrity policy.” Add your initials to indicate your agreement: **HK** **__**

5. “I have uploaded the names of anyone else other than my partner and I worked with on the problem set here” (1 point)

6. Late coins used this pset: **__** Late coins left after submission: **__**

7. Knit your ps4.qmd to an PDF file to make ps4.pdf,

  • The PDF should not be more than 25 pages. Use head() and re-size figures when appropriate.

8. (Partner 1): push ps4.qmd and ps4.pdf to your github repo.

9. (Partner 1): submit ps4.pdf via Gradescope. Add your partner on Gradescope.

10. (Partner 1): tag your submission in Gradescope

**Important:** Repositories are for tracking code. **Do not commit the data or shapefiles to your repo.** The best way to do this is with `.gitignore`, which we have covered in class. If you do accidentally commit the data, Github has a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history). The best course of action depends on whether you have pushed yet. This also means that both partners will have to download the initial raw data and any data cleaning code will need to be re-run on both partners' computers.
